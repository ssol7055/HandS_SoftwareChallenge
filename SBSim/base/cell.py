            This data structure includes the map size and the map data. The robot receives and uses
            this data structure to process. In real world, however, the robot does not know the shape
            of map. Therefore, the user can change to the mode of hiding the shape of map using `static`
            parameter. If `static` mode is off, the user does not need to give map size.

            Example::
                >>> gridMap = UserMap( mapData, True, 33, 33 )
                >>> print( gridMap.width )
                >>> print( gridMap.height )
                >>> x = 1
                >>> y = 6
                >>> cell = gridMap.map[y][x]
                >>> print( cell.req_energy )
